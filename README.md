## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use.

HTML is used the structure a webpage by using text, images, headings, and lists, which are all elements used to add and divide content on the page(s) and to describe the content to browsers or other developers. A great example would be a main menu that allows to navigate the different aspects of a webpage.

CSS is used to style a webpage, it consists of an internal style sheet and an external style sheet both of which are critical to a website's overall look and accessibility. An example would of CSS would be the placement of a logo on a webpage, or the specific colors of said logo.

Javascript is responsible for a website's functionality. It can be anywhere from as simple as having the ability to click on a pop-up menu to as complex as realtime collaboration between multiple computers.
For example javascript is responsible for animations, and even clickable buttons, making it a fundamental building block of website development.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
